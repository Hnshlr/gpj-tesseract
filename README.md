### Setting up the web-application

Once the repository of the project is cloned, or downloaded from Cranfield's Canvas, create a virtual environment for the project to store all packages the application requires. 

To create a virtual environment, first open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the backend sub-directory:

```cd ./backend```

Once in the backend directory, create a new virtual environment using the venv module in Python. The command to create a virtual environment is:

```python3 -m venv venv```

This will create a new directory called "venv" in the backend directory, which will contain all the necessary files for their virtual environment. 

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

```source env/bin/activate```

This will activate the virtual environment. You should see the name of the environment in your terminal prompt. Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the dependencies required for the project using pip. The list of the required packages is listed in the requirements.txt file in the root of the directory backend.

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Once the virtual environment is now set up and ready to use, the user can start the application by running the app.py file through their IDE, or using the following command:

```python3 app.py```
